Next goal

Create a version where the profile information is stored in the Users collection
and where users can update their profile and can view the profiles of all other users...

For pedagogial reasons, it might be better to separate the Profile info from the Users collection
so we can show how users can own data....

Currently we have user accounts and non-users can't see the Profiles.

Next step, add editing for the profiles and add a userid field to the profiles so only the user can edit his/her profile

This will be version 2.0
It is usable and functional and a minimal viable product for the AppDesign mobile app.

We can also test that it works on android 
and try to get it to work on Mac (it would be nice to have it in the app stores!)

I should also create a minimal viable product for my TYP teams ... and let them understand the products
enough to modify them ...
